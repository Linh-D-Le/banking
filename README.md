# banking

This program is created with some basic options that we are familiar with when we are using banking app.
There are: Log in, Register, Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer and Check Balance.
The information of user, such as: email, name, password, and balance will be appended into csv file (database.csv)
Due to security reason, the input of password will be hidden by asterisks. Also, password data will be hashed as being updated to csv file.
As soon as the user leaves any changes on the balance, the user's balance in csv file will be updated.
Therefore, the user can access to his/her previous balance even though he/she logged out then returns to log in.
